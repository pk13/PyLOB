Fully functioning fast Limit Order Book written in Python

PyLOB, is a fully functioning fast simulation of a limit-order-book financial exchange, developed for modelling. The aim is to allow exploration of automated trading strategies that deal with "Level 2" market data.

It is written in Python, single-threaded and opperates a standard price-time-priority. It supports both market and limit orders, as well as add, cancel and update functionality. The model is based on few simplifying assumptions, chief of which is zero latency: if a trader issues a new quote, that gets processed by the exchange, all other traders can react to it before any other quote is issue.
